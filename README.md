# Filter-Files-Inkscape
Using ElectronJS / RobotJS 😎 
This script is used mainly for a unique problem at my job.

It will run through Inkscape svg files and will filter out all images that aren't SVGS (such as images imported with paint) 
and will focus on them and save them so I can get the proper length and width.
